        <p class="one">here the contonent of mumtaj & shahjahan love story</p>
        <p class="two">I have a bicycle which is red and black in colour<br>
             My father gifted it to me on my birthday and it is my most cherished<br>
             present.<br>
                    The name of my bicycle is Turbo Thunder and it has many interesting features<br>
            It comes with different gears and a basket as well<br>
            Moreover, it also has a bottle holder and a lock<br>
            I cycle every evening with my friends from the neighbourhood<br>
            It is very liberating to me to be able to cycle<br>
            in the pleasant weather without any care<br>
            My father ensures that I always wear my protective<br>
            gear while cycling to prevent any injuries<br>
            I have decorated my cycle with stickers as well to make it more personalized<br>
            In addition, I go to my coaching classes on my bicycle only<br>
            Therefore, I love my bicycle and I wish to keep it with me even after growing up<br>
            As cycling is good for the environment and our health,<br>
            I plan to keep cycling for a long time to lead a healthy life and make the environment clean.
